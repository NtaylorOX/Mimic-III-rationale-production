# Mimic-III-rationale-production

Repo containing code for NLP placement project - application of learning from the best model (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08884) to clinical task with mimic-iii data


WHOLE CODEBASE NEEDS REFACTOR FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION

# To do:
- [ ] Refactor much of the models to clearer names/variables
- [ ] Remove redundant code and strip of any unused models
- [ ] Bring in clinicalBERT code too?
